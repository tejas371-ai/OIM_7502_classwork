# OIM7502_Midterm_Pycaret
This repository offers examples of how the **PyCaret** library can be used for different machine learning techniques, focusing on its utility for the modern Data Scientist.


## Pycaret Overview
PyCaret is an open-source, **low-code machine learning library** in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that exponentially **speeds up the experiment cycle** and makes you more productive.

PyCaret is essentially a **Python wrapper** around several machine learning libraries and frameworks, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and a few more.


## Why a Data Scientist Should Use PyCaret
The design and simplicity of PyCaret is inspired by the emerging role of **Citizen Data Scientists**. For **seasoned data scientists**, PyCaret allows for **rapid prototyping** and **benchmarking** of dozens of models with minimal code.

PyCaret is a deployment-ready library in Python, which means all the steps performed in an ML experiment can be reproduced using a pipeline that is reproducible and guaranteed for production.


## Machine Learning Modules Available
PyCaret supports a wide range of ML tasks, each with its own module:
* Classification
* Regression
* Time Series (Forecasting)
* Clustering
* Anomaly Detection


## System Requirements (Crucial for Installation)
PyCaret is tested and supported on the following 64-bit systems:

1. **Python Versions: 3.7 – 3.11**
(Note: Python 3.9 is required for Ubuntu only)


2. **Operating Systems:**
* Ubuntu 16.04 or later
* Windows 7 or later

## Installation Instructions

1. **Install PyCaret**
    To install the base functionality (minimum required dependencies), use the code:
    ```bash
    pip install pycaret
    ```

2. **Recommended for Full Functionality**
    To install all optional dependencies, use:
    ```bash
    pip install pycaret[full]
    ```
